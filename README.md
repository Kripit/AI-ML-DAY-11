# Advanced LSTM Energy Consumption Prediction

---

## Introduction

This project implements an advanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network with an attention mechanism to predict hourly energy consumption. The model is trained on synthetic energy data designed to mimic real-world patterns, including daily/weekly cycles, noise, and outliers. The goal is to develop an industry-relevant time-series forecasting model for energy management, with applications in smart grids and resource optimization.

### Objectives
- Predict hourly energy consumption (kW) using a stacked LSTM with attention.
- Handle complex data patterns with noise and outliers.
- Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

### Key Features
- **Synthetic Data**: 10,000 samples with 14 features (e.g., temperature, humidity, lagged energy).
- **Model**: Stacked LSTM (3 layers, 256 hidden units) with attention mechanism.
- **Performance**: R² = 0.7441, MAPE = 6.06% on test set.
- **Outputs**: Trained model, prediction plots, loss curves, and detailed logs.

## Methodology

### Data Generation
The dataset is synthetically generated to simulate real-world energy consumption:
- **Samples**: 10,000 hourly data points starting from January 1, 2020.
- **Features**: 14, including energy consumption, temperature, humidity, voltage, current, power factor, reactive power, cyclic encodings (hour/day), lagged energy (1h, 24h), rolling mean, and holiday flags.
- **Patterns**: Daily (24-hour) and weekly (168-hour) cycles with added noise (σ=0.3) and 2% outliers.
- **Preprocessing**: Outlier capping (IQR method), normalization (StandardScaler for features, MinMaxScaler for target), and train/validation/test split (70%/15%/15%).

### Model Architecture
The model is a stacked LSTM with an attention mechanism to focus on relevant time steps:
- **Input Size**: 14 features.
- **LSTM Layers**: 3 layers, 256 hidden units per layer.
- **Attention**: 64-dimensional attention layer to weigh sequence importance.
- **Dropout**: 0.3 to prevent overfitting.
- **Output**: Single value predicting energy consumption (kW) for the next hour.

### Training
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with learning rate = 0.0001, weight decay = 1e-5.
- **Loss**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search over:
  - Hidden size: [128, 256, 512]
  - Sequence length: [12, 24]
  - Learning rate: [0.001, 0.0001, 0.00005]
  - Number of layers: [2, 3]
- **Early Stopping**: Patience = 15 epochs, minimum 10 epochs.
- **Batch Size**: 32, with `drop_last=True` for stability.
- **Epochs**: Up to 30 per configuration.

### Evaluation
The model is evaluated on the test set using:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- R² Score

## Results

### Performance Metrics
- **RMSE**: 0.6429 kW
- **MAE**: 0.3175 kW
- **MAPE**: 6.06%
- **R² Score**: 0.7441

These metrics indicate the model explains ~74.4% of the variance in energy consumption, with predictions off by ~6.06% on average. The model captures daily patterns but struggles with outliers and noise, suggesting room for improvement (e.g., R² > 0.85).

### Outputs
- **Model**: `models/best_energy_lstm_model.pth` (trained model weights).
- **Plots**:
  - `prediction_analysis.png`: Actual vs. predicted energy for 200 test samples.
  - `attention_weights.png`: Attention weights for the first test sample.
  - `loss_curves.png`: Training and validation loss curves.
- **Log**: `training.log` with detailed training progress, including epoch counts and attention weight statistics.

### Socratic Reflection

- **Does the README clearly explain the project’s value?** (Hint: It highlights energy prediction and attention mechanism—enough for GitHub users?)
- **Are the setup instructions clear for someone new?** (Hint: Check if `pip install` and `python` commands are sufficient.)
- **How could the “Future Improvements” section guide your next steps?** (Hint: Try `sequence_length=48` or larger `hidden_size` to hit R² > 0.85.)
- **What would make the README more engaging?** (Hint: Adding a live demo or linking to a Colab notebook?)
